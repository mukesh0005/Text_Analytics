    "## What is Prompt Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Definition: Prompt engineering refers to the art and science of crafting effective queries or \"prompts\" to extract desired responses from a language model like ChatGPT.\n",
    "* Significance: Given that language models can generate multiple kinds of responses based on the input prompt, understanding how to design these prompts is critical for the success of chatbot solutions.\n"

    "## Importance in Chatbot Development\n",
    "* User Experience: The way a prompt is constructed can drastically affect the user experience, potentially making the chatbot more intuitive and responsive.\n",
    "* Functional Accuracy: Well-engineered prompts ensure that the chatbot provides information that is accurate and contextually relevant.\n",
    "* Efficiency: Good prompts can minimize the back-and-forths between the user and the chatbot, speeding up the information retrieval process."

    "## Components of a Good Prompt\n",
    "* Clarity: The prompt should be clear and unambiguous, asking exactly what you need.\n",
    "* Context: If the model needs to be aware of the situation or setting, include this in the prompt.\n",
    "* Tone: The tone of the prompt should be aligned with the chatbot’s purpose and the expectations of the target audience.\n",
    "* Specificity: Narrow down the scope of the prompt to get more accurate and targeted responses.\n",
    "* Instruction: In some cases, you might need to include additional instructions on how the model should respond."

    "To design a chatbot for answering questions about the University of South Florida's MSBAIS program, consider the following guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define Objectives: Are you providing general information, admissions guidance, or course-specific details?\n",
    "* Target Audience: Understand that your primary users will be prospective students; hence the language should be accessible yet formal.\n",
    "* Drafting Prompts:\n",
    "* Bad Example: \"Tell me something.\"\n",
    "* Good Example: \"Can you provide an overview of the MSBAIS program at the University of South Florida?\"\n",

    "## More Techniques in Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concatenation and Decomposition\n",
    "* Concatenation: Combining multiple queries into a single prompt can sometimes extract composite answers. This is especially useful for context-dependent queries.\n",
    "  * Example: \"Tell me about the MSBAIS program at the University of South Florida. Also, specify the prerequisites for admission.\"\n",
    "* Decomposition: Some complex queries can be broken down into simpler prompts that are executed sequentially. This helps when you need nuanced or highly detailed answers.\n",
    "  * Example: First ask, \"Tell me about the MSBAIS program,\" then ask, \"What are the prerequisites for admission?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contextual Embedding\n",
    "* Utilizing pre-set or dynamic context helps in scenarios where continuity or session-based interaction is required.\n",
    "  * Example: If the chatbot is about university admissions, setting a context like \"You are an admission counselor for the University of South Florida's MSBAIS program\" helps the model maintain the role throughout the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Statements and Logic\n",
    "* Using conditional statements to guide the model can help to refine the response further.\n",
    "  * Example: \"If the MSBAIS program offers a data science track, what are the core courses?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Active Learning and Feedback Loop\n",
    "* Use a feedback mechanism to dynamically adapt the prompts based on user interaction or behavior.\n",
    "* Technique: Implement an upvoting or downvoting system for answers and adapt prompts based on user feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Considerations\n",
    "* Multilingual Support: When your audience is diverse, engineer prompts to ask the model to translate its response into other languages.\n",
    "* Data Sensitivity: Explicitly instruct the model to avoid generating sensitive or personally identifiable information.\n",
    "* Length and Complexity: Balance the complexity and length of the prompt with the intended depth of the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "* Version Control for Prompts: Maintain versions of successful prompts, akin to how you would manage code, for iterative improvements and historical reference.\n",
    "* User Testing: Regularly update prompts based on extensive user testing to ensure that they meet user needs and expectations.\n",
    "* Monitor and Update: Language models get updated; hence your prompts may require adjustments to remain effective over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluative Metrics for Prompt Efficacy\n",
    "* Precision: Measures how many of the generated responses accurately answered the prompt.\n",
    "* Recall: Measures how many of the correct answers were generated among all possible correct answers.\n",
    "* Latency: Time taken to produce a response; especially crucial in real-time applications.\n",
